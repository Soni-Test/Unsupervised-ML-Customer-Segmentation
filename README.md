## Problem Description

In this project, your task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.


## Step used for Analysis 

- Data Cleaning </br>
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) </br>
- RFM </br>
- Clustering </br>
- Cluster Profiling </br>
- Conclusion </br>

## **Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model to determine customer value:**

The RFM model is quite useful model in retail customer segmentation where only the data of customer transaction is available. RFM stands for the three dimensions:

Recency – How recently did the customer purchase? - Number of days since last purchase </br> Frequency – How often do they purchase? - The total number of purchases </br> Monetary Value – How much do they spend? - The total money customer spent </br> A combination of these three attributes can be defined to assign a quantitative value to customers. e.g. A customer who recently bought high value products and transacts regularly is a high value customer.


## Model used for analysis 

* K-Means Clustering</br>
  - Silhouette Analysis
  - Elbow Method
* DBSCAN Clustering 
* Hierarchical Clustering </br>
  - Agglomerative Clustering (Bottom-up approach using tree like diagram called Dendogram)
